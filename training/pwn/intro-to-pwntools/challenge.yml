  We will be using pwntools in order to interact with the challenge here: `nc chal1.sieberr.live 10002`.


  In this challenge, you will be solving mathematical equations. More information is found when you connect to the remote instance.


  ### Common pwntools commands


  Please refer to the cheatsheet here to learn more about pwntools: https://enxgmatic.github.io/ctf/pwntools-cheatsheet/ 

  
  Also, I recommend simply googling by yourself too :)


  ### Other notes


  Pwntools is also used in other categories, such as crypto, in order to interact with a remote instance.


  Other tools needed to solve the other pwn challenges: [gdb](https://www.gdbtutorial.com/tutorial/how-install-gdb), [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) (an extension to gdb)'
