# Sieberrsec CTF 5.0 - Introduction to Pwntools

## Description

This challenge serves as an introduction to pwntools, a python module frequently used to solve pwn challenges.

To install pwntools, do `pip install pwntools`. 

We will be using pwntools in order to interact with the challenge here: `nc chal1.sieberr.live 10002`.

In this challenge, you will be solving mathematical equations. More information is found when you connect to the remote instance.

### Common pwntools commands

Please refer to the cheatsheet here to learn more about pwntools: https://enxgmatic.github.io/ctf/pwntools-cheatsheet/ 

Also, I recommend simply googling by yourself too :)

### Other notes

Pwntools is also used in other categories, such as crypto, in order to interact with a remote instance.

Other tools needed to solve the other pwn challenges: [gdb](https://www.gdbtutorial.com/tutorial/how-install-gdb), [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) (an extension to gdb)
