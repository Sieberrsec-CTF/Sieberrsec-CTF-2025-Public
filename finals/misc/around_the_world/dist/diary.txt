Nowadays, I find myself looking ‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‍out the window for a little‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬ too long, my eyes ‌‌‌‌‍‬‌﻿following the clouds ‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‌as I wonder where they‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‍'ve been and where they're‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬ heading. No routine can‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‍ ‌‌‌‌‌‬﻿‬quell the restlessness that exists within ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‌me. ‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‌It's love, I believe, love for‌‌‌‌‌‌‬‬ the world I have yet to see.‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‌ 

Deep down, I want to‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‌ escape from this place. My mind has wandered off, where I see‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‌ myself‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‌ strolling through the neon-lit nights of‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌﻿ Tokyo and sipping ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‬‬tea in the Kyoto alley. 

‌‌‌‌‌‬﻿﻿I long for ‌‌‌‌‌‬﻿﻿the‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‌ trip not to escape, but to connect‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‍. I‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‬ want to see the way people live, the way their cultures‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬‍ are and how they celebrate the small ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‍things in life. I want‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬ to wake up under a ‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‌different sky and still feel at home somehow‌‌‌‌‌‬﻿‬. I think that’s‌‌‌‌‍‬‌﻿ what I’‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿﻿m really searching‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‍ for: pieces of myself scattered‌‌‌‌‌‬﻿﻿ across the world, waiting to ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌﻿be found in‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‌ strangers, in stories, in streets I’ve never walked.
One day, I’ll go. ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‬I don’t know when, maybe soon, perhaps when I least‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‬ expected it. Maybe one day, I’ll grab my bag, book my‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‍ tickets and step into‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬ the‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍﻿ world with ‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‬open arms.
