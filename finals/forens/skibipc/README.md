## Description

Good day Sir/Ma'am,

We managed to detect a spy named John trying to penetrate our forces using his SeKure Integrated Big Impenetrable Personal Compootur!

Attached is the dump of the spy's computer, which contains some of the notes he took regarding some kind of *flag*. My boss also needs his account password, FYIP.

Submit part 1 and part 2 of the flag with the password in the following format: `sctf{part1_part2_password}`. For example, if part 1 is `abc_123`, part 2 is `def_456` and the password is `toilet`, the flag is `sctf{abc_123_def_456_toilet}`.

[Get the dump here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aj7M9b9DINYYrYNGqP2-9jAL9ntKHtsJ/view)

FYNAP.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Anti-Spy and Counter-Penetration Task Force
