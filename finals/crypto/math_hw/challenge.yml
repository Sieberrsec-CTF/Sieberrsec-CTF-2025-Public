description: 'I met my weird math teacher on the street and he said that if I could do
  his special homework by guessing his matrix in 15 seconds I would get extra credit.
  
  
  I dont know how to escape the matrix but right now without the credit I need 120% for 
  finals to pass. Can you help me?'
