# multiplier effect

## Description

an initial increase in spending prompts producers to produce at a greater output, generating more factor income for households which provide factors of production to these firms. these households then spend part of the additional income on consumer goods, while the rest of the additional income is saved, taxed or spent on imported goods. this generates a second round of increase in spending, which produces a second round of increase in factor income for households. this process continues until the increase in spending becomes negligible, hence leading to a greater increase in national income from an initial increase in spending.
