## Description

SICK and TIRED of fancy mancy assembly, I''ve decided to make my own CPU! 
BEHOLD, THE KEKCULATOR!
deisnged wit sekurity 1000 in mind, this UBER fast UBER smart and UBER secure calculator will surely not let you down!
ps: the first solution under 700 operations will win a boulder movement pass from yours truly, or $20 cash. Whichever you prefer. PLEASE open a ticket if you are attempting this and are unsure of what an "operation" entails
